# Hello-World
Hi, I am a startup coder who is currently learning. I plan to make games using 3D rendering and things associated with that topic.
The world of coding fascinates me, knowing that almost everything uses code somehow.
The world of 3D is just amazing in how it works, so I want to learn how to do it, like in Minecraft.
I plan to make things like simple games using raytracing to render things as 3d and add collisions so you just don't clip right through walls.
Other things are adding interactive features like chests you can loot,(with animations of course), possible enemies that you have to defeat, and more!
I plan to eventually post something, but it might take me a while. The only remotely close thing to this that I have done is using Scratch.
But Scratch is kinda easy, so I am giving myself a challenge: To make a raytracing game. I have only ever made a 3d render, so this might be hard.
But never the less, I will eventually find a way to make my dream come true (maybe).
I may make other projects, but they won't be as crazy as my goal project.
